# What can be done with this data in 3 hours?

We are interested in the possibilities of what can be done with a
dataset like the this in a few hours. You should think of this task as
an opportunity to show how you might approach a problem and that there
are no right or wrong answers, nor are there right or wrong tools to
solve it.

We have a few thoughts around what could be nice to see after spending
a few hours with this data:

* Report
* Dashboard
* Graph
* Reproducible results and workflow
* Web-based
* Map
* Visual
* Version control

Have fun and we look forward to seeing your interpretation of this data.
